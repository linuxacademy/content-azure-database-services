# content-azure-database-services

Welcome to the official repo for the Linux Academy "Using Microsoft Azure Database Services" course. Here you will find resources to use alongside the videos and hands-on labs.

I hope that this content is useful both for those in the course as well as anyone else wanting to learn about Azure database services.

Happy learning!
